# Advent of code 2024

Every year I attempt the advent of code pizzles on the [AoC website](https://adventofcode.com/2024/). I use this as an opportunity to learn a new programming language. This year I have chosen [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

I am very far from a high end programmer, but I know my way around a language or two. Certainly enough to be dangerous with other people's code base. As such, I do these puzzles for fun.

Basically, that is my disclaimer that none of the code in this repo should be considered good enough to copy or use as reference.

## Thanks
I want to extend my thanks and appreciation to [Eric Wastl](https://was.tl/) and everyone who works on the advent of code, for all the hard work you put in to these puzzles every year.
